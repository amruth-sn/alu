# Arithmetic Logic Unit

The primary purpose of this project was to exercise my knowledge of Vivado Verilog. From start to finish, this project used behavioral (procedural and continuous) Verilog. In addition, every top-level module includes a testbench. These testbenches provide adequate environments for testing in order to observe the functionality of my designs. I used the testbenches in order to iterate through every possible input that mattered in each module and affirm that my outputs matched what was fed through, depending on the functionality of the module itself. The arithmetic logic unit, or an ALU for short, was design-oriented in approach. It involved creating individually functional modules that worked together with the help of a 4:1 multiplexer in order to choose a certain function to perform.
